# QMC_SSE
stochastic series expansion(QMC) for 2d Heisenberg model
It's a naive julia version of Anders' Sandvik's code(http://physics.bu.edu/~sandvik/trieste12/ssebasic.f90)
I am new to julia, so the code may seem unmature. 
Amazingly, my tests show that the julia version code is almost good as the fortran version code!
